# Continuous Payment Smart Contract

Continous Payments allows contractors to receive payment for their work, anytime and instantly from employers
through a smart contract. The smart contract automatically starts recording time and issues payment at an 
agreed upon rate from both parties. Funds can be withdrawn whenever by both parties.
